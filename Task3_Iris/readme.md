**Iris Prediction**<br />
**Overview**<br />
The Iris Species Prediction Project is a data science venture aimed at accurately classifying iris flowers into different species using the Random Forest Classifier. This project leverages machine learning techniques to classify iris flowers based on their petal and sepal characteristics, contributing to our understanding of plant species classification.<br />

**Dataset**<br />
The dataset used in this project is the "Iris Dataset" from Kaggle.<br />
The dataset contains one CSV files.<br />
Features include information about the flowers species such as its petal width, its length.<br />

**Dependencies**<br />
Python3<br />
Pandas<br />
Supervised Learning<br />
Machine Learning Algorithm<br />
Classification Algorithms<br />
