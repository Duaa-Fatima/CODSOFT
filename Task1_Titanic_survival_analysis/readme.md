**Titanic Survival Prediction**<br />
**Overview**<br />
This project is an attempt to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques, specifically the Decision Tree algorithm. The dataset used for this project contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including attributes like age, sex, class, and whether they survived or not.
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify passengers as either survivors or non-survivors based on the available data.<br />

**Dataset**<br />
The dataset used in this project is the "Titanic dataset" from Kaggle.<br />
The dataset contains one CSV files.<br />
Features include passenger information such as age, sex, class, and fare, among others.<br />
