**Movie Rating Prediction**<br />
**Overview**<br />
I have completed a project focused on predicting movie ratings, particularly within the Bollywood film industry. The project utilized two regression models: Linear Regressor and Random Forest Regressor, with the Random Forest Regressor yielding superior results. The dataset primarily encompasses key attributes of Bollywood movies, with a particular emphasis on factors such as genre, director, and the leading actors in the films.<br/>
**Dataset**<br />
The dataset used in this project is the "IMBD movies india" from Kaggle.<br />
The dataset contains one CSV file.<br />
Features include movie name, director, Duration, Rating and many other.<br />

**Dependencies**<br />
Python3<br />
Pandas<br />
Supervised Learning<br />
Machine Learning Algorithm<br />
Regression Algorithms<br />

**The notebook is the basic implementation of the ml including**<br />
data cleaning<br />
feature extraction<br />
splitting data <br />
feature scaling<br />
model building<br />
testing of model<br />
